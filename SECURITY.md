# Security Policy

## Our Commitment to Security

At Freemius, the security of our platform and the trust of our community are our highest priorities. We are dedicated to
maintaining a secure environment for all users and developers. We deeply value the contributions of the security
community in helping us achieve this goal.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have discovered a security vulnerability in Freemius, we encourage you to responsibly disclose it to
us. To ensure confidentiality and the safety of our users, please refrain from opening a public issue. Instead, report
the vulnerability using the [GitHub Security Advisory](https://github.com/Freemius/freemius-js/security/advisories/new)
tool.

We are committed to reviewing all reports as quickly as possible. Once verified, we will work diligently to address the
issue and release a fix. Your responsible disclosure helps us protect the community and improve the security of our
platform.

## Acknowledging Contributions

We greatly appreciate the efforts of security researchers and community members who help us identify and resolve
vulnerabilities. Your contributions make Freemius stronger and safer for everyone. Thank you for your dedication to
improving security.
